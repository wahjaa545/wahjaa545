Hi my name is Wade and i'm a 3D / Technical Artist who does small electronic projects as a hobbie
I do some programming when I'm working with others on games, but its not my main focus.
I'm currently going to collage (2020-2023) and don't have time to do many personal projects

(Please excuse any spelling / grammer mistakes in my code, I have ddyslexia and its hard sometimes for me to recognize these mistakes)
